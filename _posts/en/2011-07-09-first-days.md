I am sure this is going to be a really nice work. Why? Because of the team. Emma met me upon my arrival in Cavendish and gave me a brief tour of the Mott building where the SP group is based. I learned a funny word: a pigeonhole - now I own one! Then she introduced me to the THz group members: [Anthony](http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/ab735.html), [Shruti](http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/sb732.html) and [Yash](http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/ys365.html). All of them are PhD students and so far they have not shown any sign of being annoyed by my questions. In fact, I could not imagine a friendlier and more helpful team.

Then I met [Harvey](http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/heb1000.html), our supervisor, who showed me the scientific facilities: the MBE reactor, cleanrooms and the THz lab. If I understood well, he is a grower, which means that all the QCL structures I will be processing are prepared by him. He taught me 101 MBE growing in half an hour which was really interesting - for the first time I was told about the growth process by someone who actually _feels_ it. This is the knowledge that you don't find in textbooks and one of the many reasons for going to a lab.

I got my own desk, a computer and many theses and books to read. The computer network here is really well developed - you get your own login to access the resources, everyone has a shared folder on the network, there are several printers connected to the network. And, of course, you can read most of the scientific journals on-line, but we have that in Wrocław as well, only here it is a bit more developed.

Now I have to wait a few days for the cleanroom training to start - until then, I will not be able to do the processing so most of my time I sit there reading and asking small questions but there is a lot of big ones in queue...
