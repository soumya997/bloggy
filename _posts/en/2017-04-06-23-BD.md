Above is last week's summary. 37 hours out of planned 45. Not terrible, but to put it diplomatically, there is room for improvement.

I am pretty much done with one chapter. I still need to write about process development, but this is simple enough to leave it for later. Mainly I will have to make diagrams in Inkscape to illustrate fabrication steps.

On to the next one. It will be about work which is already published[^bcb]. I did the simulations for that paper and then extended this initial concept onto different lasers. The last-minute data I was collecting last month were for this chapter, and there will hopefully be some more coming from my colleague this week.
